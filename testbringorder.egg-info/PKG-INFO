The tool is aimed at helping data scientists formulate their hypotheses better. When a hypothesis has been formulated clearly, the following is expected after analysis:

- the data analysis environment can state whether the hypothesis was supported or not

- any analysis that was not directly related to hypothesis testing can be identified

## Installation

### Dependencies 

1. Install dependencies

```bash
poetry install
```

### Execute program

1. Go into virtual environment

```bash
poetry shell
```

2. Run in project folder. A *bogui.ipynb* file should appear in /src - folder.

```bash
py2nb src/bogui.py
```

3. Run in project folder

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Go to the address where the Jupyter Notebook- server is running on localhost. Navigate to **src/bogui.ipynb**


5. Add a new code line and write depending on where you are in the project folder ``` from src.bogui import BOGui ```

6. Choose deductive or inductive option

- **Decuctive**:  Insert your *hypothesis* and *null hypothesis* to the fields. E.g. *x>0* and *x=0*
- **Inductive**: 



## Run unittests

1. Run from main folder

```bash
pytest src
```

## Run style check

1. Run from main folder

```bash
pylint src
```

## Run robot tests
1. Navigate to the main folder and go to virtual environment

```bash
poetry shell
```

2. Run robot test script

```bash
./run_robot_tests.sh
```

If the script won't run, give it execution rights first and try again
```bash
chmod +x run_robot_tests.sh
```

If the first run fails, try once again. Sometimes there are some connection issues.
When you are done, you can exit the virtual environment with command

```bash
exit
```
