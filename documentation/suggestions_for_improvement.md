## Suggestions for improvement

These suggestions for improvement are a collection of ideas that have developed throughout the project. They follow the chronological order of the application. The subheadings are in accordance with the user guide for the sake of clarity. 

### Launching BringOrder
- Possibility to add and import the API key a .env -file.
- Encryption for API key if it was retrieved from a .env -file.
- The API key is asked in a proper popup.

### Data import 
- Possivility to import data in other file formats than csv.
- Error handling in situations where the user does not have access rights to the selected file.

### Testing hypothesis
- More comprehensive process of verifying that the hypotheses are valid, conceptually clear and related to a body of theory & available techniques.
- Adding the option to use the assistant also after running cells. 
- User receives a warning if performing tests with unlemmatized data. 

### Explorative analysis
- Providing the user with techniques to perform explorative analysis on the dataset.
- User receives a warning if performing tests with unlemmatized data. 

### AI Assistant
- A larger variety of assistants to choose from e.g. Inference API from Hugging Face.
- Possibility to automatically send additional information about the dataset to the assistant for improved quality of answers. 
- Possibility to modify previous question that was sent to the assistant.


### Slides
- User is asked if s/he wants to save the project as a pptx when user imports new data. (Now the question is only asked at the end of BringOrder. Only the presentation related to the last dataset is deleted if the user does not want to keep it. Other presentations do remain.)

### General
- The possibility to close the Notebook and continue from the place they left.
- The possibility to load the most frequently used libraries (pandas, numpy, scipy) automatically before a Notebook session.
